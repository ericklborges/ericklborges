## Hi there, I'm Erick Borges ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a Swift developer who primarily focusses on iOS since 2018, and a begginer Web developer.

Currently, I work on the [Stone Co.](https://github.com/stone-payments) iOS app supporting thousands of retailers every day :D

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **web development with Nxt.js**
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **Swift open source**
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything about **view coding with UIKit**
- âš¡ Fun fact: tabs > spaces

### iOS thoughts

- AloeStackView, TinyConstraints, Swiftgen and Swiftlint are must have frameworks
- UIKit with View Coding to build interfaces FTW (don't know SwiftUI yet)
- UIStackViews whenever possible
- Github Actions or Bitrise goes well with Fastlane for a CI
- Danger helps me keep Pull Requests in order
